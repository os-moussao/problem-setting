\begin{problem}{Closest Palindrome}{standard input}{standard output}{2 seconds}{256 megabytes}

Aya is bored during her math lessons (too easy). To keep herself occupied, she decides to play a game with her friend called Palindrome Game.

In this game, one of the girls gives a number $n$ and the other has to find the closest palindrome number to $n$ among all palindromes greater than or equal to $n$.

A palindrome number is a number that reads the same forward or backward. For example $12321$, $100001$ and $1$ are palindrome numbers, while $112$ and $1021$ are not.

Aya knows that you are an excellent programmer and challenges you to write a program that can play the Palindrome Game. Your program should take a number $n$ as input and output the closest palindrome number to $n$ which is greater than or equal to $n$.

\InputFile
A positive integer $n$ $(1 \leq n \leq 10^6)$.

\OutputFile
Output the closest palindrome number to $n$ greater than or equal to $n$. 

\Examples

\begin{example}
\exmpfile{example.01}{example.01.a}%
\exmpfile{example.02}{example.02.a}%
\end{example}

\Note
In the first example, $11$ is already palindrome.

In the second example, $1441$ is the closest palindrome to $1337$.
