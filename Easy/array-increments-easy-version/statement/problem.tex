\begin{problem}{Array Increments (Easy Version)}{standard input}{standard output}{2 seconds}{256 megabytes}

You are given an array $A$ of $N$ integers. You have to process $Q$ queries.

In each query you are given an integer $x$, you have to add $x$ to every element at an odd position, and subtract it from elements with an even position, and print the value of $f(A)$, where $f(A) = a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 +\; \dots \; \pm \; a_n$

Note here that the array is one-indexed, so when we say odd positions, we mean the first element, the third element, etc...

\InputFile
The first line of the input has two integers $N$ and $Q$ $(1 \leq N,Q \leq 10^3)$: the number of values in the array, and the number of queries.

The second line has $N$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ $(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9)$: the values of the array.


Finally, there are $Q$ lines describing the queries, each line contains an integer $x$ $(1 \leq x \leq 10^4)$.

\OutputFile
For each query, print the value $f(A)$ after changing the array values accordingly.

\Example

\begin{example}
\exmpfile{example.01}{example.01.a}%
\end{example}

\Note
Please consider that the answer will not always fit in 32-bit integer type, you'll have to use 64-bit integers instead (like \t{long long} in C/C++).
