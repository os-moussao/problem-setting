\begin{problem}{Greatest Divisor (Version 2)}{standard input}{standard output}{1.5 seconds}{256 megabytes}

\textbf{The difference between this version and the first version of this problem is the range where $n$ belongs to. This time $n$ can be negative.}

You are given an integer $n$, you have to find its greatest divisor that is \textbf{different than} $n$.

\InputFile
A single line containing a positive integer $ -10^5 \leq n \leq -2 \;\; or \;\; 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 $.

\OutputFile
The greatest divisor $d$ of $n$, where $d \neq n$.

\Example

\begin{example}
\exmpfile{example.01}{example.01.a}%
\end{example}

\Note
Divisors of $20$ are $1, 2, 4, 5, 10, \; and \; 20$ the greatest of them that is different than $20$ is $10$.
