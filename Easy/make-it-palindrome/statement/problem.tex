\begin{problem}{Make It Palindrome}{standard input}{standard output}{2 seconds}{256 megabytes}

Oussama always likes to challenge his friends Anass, Said and Ayoub in codingame clash-of-code. Last time they tried to play the site was down, so Oussama decided to give his friends a coding challenge that he created himself. Unfortunately, none of them could solve it, therefore he decided to put this easy task in a CPC contest. The statement goes as follows...


You are given a string $S$ consisting of lower case letters only, you need to know if you can rearrange its characters in a way to make it a palindrome string. If you can do so, print \t{"YES"}, otherwise print \t{"NO"}.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward, for example strings \t{"x"}, \t{"anasana"}, \t{"aba"}, \t{"abccba"} are palindromes, but strings \t{"abaa"}, \t{"awbx"} are not.

\InputFile
One single line consists of a string $S$, $(1 \leq length\; of \; S \leq 1000)$.

\OutputFile
Output \t{"YES"} if you can make it palindrome, otherwise print \t{"NO"}.

\Examples

\begin{example}
\exmpfile{example.01}{example.01.a}%
\exmpfile{example.02}{example.02.a}%
\end{example}
