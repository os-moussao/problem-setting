\begin{problem}{Chechers Turn}{standard input}{standard output}{2 seconds}{256 megabytes}

Fode and Oussama like playing \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkers}{checkers} in the playground. As Fode always beats him, he decides to let Oussama play two successive turns each time before he plays.

The game goes as follows: Oussama plays the $1$-st turn and the $2$-nd turn, then Fode plays the $3$-rd, Oussama plays the $4$-th and $5$-th, then Fode plays the $6$-th, and so forth...

They want to know who will play the $n$-th turn. \textbf{(Oussama plays first)}.

\InputFile
A single integer $n$ $(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18})$.

\OutputFile
Print "$Oussama$" if he is the one playing the $n$-th turn, otherwise print "$Fode$".
